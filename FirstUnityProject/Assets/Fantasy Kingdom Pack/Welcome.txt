Thank you for purchasing the Stylized Fantasy Kingdom/Castle Environment!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
Multiple demoscenes are included aswell.


If you like the package we would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!



Some tips:
Use the Post Processing Stack for better visuals (Availabe for free as a Unity Plugin)

In order to use the foliage that is included, you must first create a Terrain, then add the textures in the 'Paint Details' tab and paint the grass/flowers across the terrain. (There are also plenty of tutorials online explaining this)

In order to change the texture of your characters, simply open the Material tab and apply the variation you want onto the character.
